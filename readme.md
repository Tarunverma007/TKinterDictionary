Welcome to the exciting world of GUI programming with Tkinter. This project aims at getting you acquainted with Tkinter, the built-in graphical user interface (GUI) interface for all standard Python distributions.

Tkinter is suited for application to a wide variety of areas ranging from small desktop applications, to use in scientific modeling and research endeavors across various disciplines.The purpose of this project is to make you comfortable with Tkinter. It aims at introducing you to various components of GUI programming with TkinterBy the end of this project, you will have developed several partly functional dummy applications such as the one shown as follows

The features that make Tkinter a great choice for GUI programming include:-

    It is simple to learn (simpler than any other GUI package for Python)
    Relatively little code can produce powerful GUI application
    Layered design ensures that it is easy to graspfIt is portable across all operating systemsfIt is easily accessible as it comes pre-installed with standard Python distribution
    None of the other GUI toolkits has all of these features at the same time.

To test if you have the correct Tkinter version on your Python installation, type the following commands in your IDE:

import tkinter

print(tkinter._test())

This should pop up a window where the first line in the window reads This is Tcl/Tk version 8.5.

We will begin with what we will require for this breif project:

    JSON File - Which acts as the source of data having names as keys and the definitions as value

       2.A Photo- Which will act as our background

    3.Obviously a script for our code
